The standard <script> tag in HTML is used to embed code in an HTML document and usually allows JavaScript code to run in the browser.
When the <script> tag is used, the script is downloaded and executed where it is stated, so the browser will parse any remaining HTML
elements after the script has run. If the <script async> tag is used, the script is fetched and downloaded in parallel to the parsing 
of other HTML elements, and then it is executed as soon as it is downloaded. If the <script defer> tag is used, the script is also 
downloaded in parallel to the parsing of HTML elements, but the script is executed after the remaining HTML has been parsed.
