JCSS:
Because the OR operator evaluates from left to right and the expression evaluates to True, "JCSS" is outputed because it is the first
True term in the OR expression. firstName and lastName are both empty strings, so they evaluate to False, but nickName is a non-empty 
string, so it is True.

Anonymous:
The AND operator looks for the first False operand, but in this case since both nickName and "Anonymous" evaluate to True, the AND
expression also evaluates to True and returns the last operand: "Anonymous". Now all the expression that remains is all ORs, so it 
looks for the first True operand from left to right, and in this case the last operand, "Anonymous", is the first True operand.
