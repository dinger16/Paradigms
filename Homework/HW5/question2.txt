It is generally a good idea to place the CSS <link> between <head></head> to avoid any latency issues as the browser parses all of the HTML elements.
By putting the CSS in the head, the styling for the page is retrieved before the remaining elements are parsed, so the elements that appear on the 
page are styled the way that the user intended. Along the same lines, it is good practice to put the and JS <script> tag directly before the 
</body> tag, so that the JS code is executed after the browser has parsed all of the HTML elements in the document. If the JS <script> were placed in
the header, the HTML elements which the script referred to would not be rendered in time for the execution of the script.
