Declaration using var gives the variable function level scope, but using let to declare a variable gives that variable block scope.
In this case, the conditionals for positive and zero both give the result variable function level scope, and therefore, the string
is able to be returned outside of the conditionals. However, the negative conditional uses block scope to assign a value to result,
so the variable can't be returned at the end of the function because it was assigned inside the conditional.
